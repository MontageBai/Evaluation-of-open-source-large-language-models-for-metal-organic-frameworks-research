"All the laboratory small batch syntheses of MOFs were based on literature reports with slight modifications and carried out under the same reaction conditions. Changing only the type of metal salts. Ln(NO3)3°§xH2O (9.6 mmol) where Ln = Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm and Yb and H3BTC (8 mmol) were added to a solvent mixture of N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF, 50 mL) and deionized water (10 mL) in a 100 mL glass vial.
The synthesized MOFs catalysts require further activation to approach the theoretical structural pore size. This step starts by replacing the high-boiling solvent with a low-boiling solvent and then removing the low-boiling solvent under vacuum heating. As an example, MOF-76 (Y), the material was tested for N2 adsorption at 77 K and CO2 adsorption at 273 K and 298 K after vacuum activation at 250 °„C for 18 h as shown in Figure S1-S3."
"The corresponding IAST selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 increased to 1.26 at 298 K and 1.36 at 273 K, being comparable to many benchmark materials, such as TJT-100 (1.2),26 NPU-1 (1.32),32 NPU-2 (1.52),32 Azole-Th-1 (1.46),31 UiO-67(NH2)2 (1.7),28 Zn-atz-ipa(1.7),33 and Zn-atz-oba (1.27).3Besides, the C2H2/C2H4 selectivity also increased to 1.61 at 298 K and 2.31 at 273 K. Therefore, the overall separation performance of BUT-151 is quite good among all reported MOF materials (Table S2?). The Qst values of C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 are determined to be 36.81, 23.95, and 31.06 kJ mol?1 respectively (Fig. S10®C12 and S14?), using adsorption isotherms at 298 K and 273 K."
"The results of the thermogravimetric tests are shown in Figure 5a, MOF-76 (Y) remains stable at up to 550 oC and undergoes a rapid one-step weight loss from 550-650 oC, indicating decomposition of the material. Under N2 atmosphere, MOF-76 (Y) underwent two steps of desolvation. In general, MOF-like materials usually begin to degrade at 200-350 oC, while MOF-76 (Y) expresses excellent thermal stability due to the high coordination number and thermal stability of the metal center."
"The next research focused on the study of the catalytic versatility of MOF-76 (Y). As shown in Table 2 and Figure S8-S11. Generally high catalytic activity was observed for a series of epoxy derivatives with different substituents. The results show a certain regularity in the effect of different substituents on the yield. The results indicate that the material has good catalytic activity for small molecule-like substrates, however, it is less active for large molecule substrates containing benzene rings, which is mainly due to the detrimental effect of spatial site resistance on cycloaddition."
"The cycling stability was tested by reacting at 80 °„C. for 4 h and cycling 10 times at that condition. At the end of each cycle, pairs of MOF-76 (Y) were separated by centrifugation and washed three times using methanol and dried at 80 °„C. As shown in Figure 5b, the fluctuation of the activity of MOF-76 (Y) within 10 cycles was within the experimental error, and the catalytic effect was basically the same, indicating that the catalyst has good cycling stability. Powder diffraction was also performed on the recovered catalysts, and their PXRD patterns were basically consistent, confirming the structural integrity."
