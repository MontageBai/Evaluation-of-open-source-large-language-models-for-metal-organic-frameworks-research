"Context: The solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2﹞6H2O, 4∩,4∪,4?,4?(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrabiphenyl-4-carboxylic acid (TCBPE), and 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)benzene (Bpb) in DMF led to the formation of light yellow crystals of [Zn2(TCBPE)(Bpb)] (BUT-111).

"Context: To evaluate the BET surface area and total pore volume of BUT-111 and BUT-112, the nitrogen adsorption?desorption isotherms for the activated samples of BUT-111 and 112 were measured at 77 K. The uptakes of N2 of BUT-111- and BUT-112-activated at 0.98 P/P0 are about 186 and 287 cm3﹞g-1 at STP, respectively, and the BET surface areas calculated are 578 and 1099 m2﹞g-1, respectively.

Context: Our initial study started with the BUT-150 material. The microporous feature and unique open nickel site motivated us to evaluate the C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation performance. Interestingly, BUT-150 showed preferential adsorption of C2H6 over C2H4, as shown in Fig. 4a每b. The uptake of C2H2 (5.53 mmol g-1) and C2H6 (4.30 mmol g-1) is higher than that of C2H4 (4.26 mmol g-1) for BUT-150 at 298 K. The adsorption capacity of BUT-150 is comparable to the uptake (C2H2 : 5.9 mmol g; and C2H6 : 5.32 mmol g-1) of the recent benchmark material UiO-67-(NH2) 2.28 The same adsorption preference was observed at 273 K, with higher adsorption capacity (Fig. 4b). The heat of adsorption (Qst) was calculated based on the adsorption isotherms at 298 K and 273 K using the Virial method. The Qst for C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 are 30.5, 23.68, and 23.87 kJ mol-1 respectively (Fig. S7每S9 and S13?). The higher Qst for C2H2 and C2H6 correlate with the higher adsorption capacity of these two gases. The C2H2 / C2H4 and C2H6 / C2H4 selectivity was calculated to be 1.82 and 1.15 at 298 K according to the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST). The adsorption selectivity and Qst for BUT-150 are quite different from other MOFs with open metal sites which usually exhibit stronger binding for C2H4. This may be attributed to the low open metal site density as compared to MOF-74 and UTSA-74. In addition, this penta-coordinated nickel may have weak coordination with guest molecules. Although the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity is not impressive, the C2H2/C2H4 selectivity (1.82) is quite good compared with reported MOFs for ternary C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixture separation, such as TJT-100 (1.8), NUM-9a (1.5), Azole-Th-1, NPU-1 (1.4), UiO-67-(NH2)2 (2.1), and Zn-atz-oba (1.43). To promote C2H6 / C2H4 selectivity and ternary separation performance, we extended the conjugation of the linker to enhance the C每H/p interaction. Replacement of the bipyridine unit with phenanthroline led to reduced pore size (Fig. 1c), the smaller pore size and stronger C每H/p interaction could simultaneously boost the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. As shown in Fig. 4d and e, the adsorption isotherms at 298 K and 273 K for BUT-151 exhibit a higher preference for C2H6 (3.99 mmol g-1) over C2H4 (3.72 mmol g-1), which demonstrated the above hypothesis.
Question: What are the adsorption capacity, selectivity (IAST), and heat of adsorption (Qst) for each gas of the BUT-150, and please output them to me separately in a specific format, such as a tabular grid. Also, I would like their information to be as complete as possible."
"Context: The catalytic cycloaddition reaction of ECH was carried out at 100 ∼C and 1 bar CO2 atmosphere, excellent catalytic performance of MOF-76(Y) was observed with high TOF (64.72 h-1) as shown in Table 2 (NMR as shown in Figures S45-46).
Question: What is the TOF value of the catalyst catalyzing the ECH cycloaddition at 100 ∼C and 1 bar CO2 atmosphere."
"Context: Catalyst stability and reusability are key factors in the practical organic synthesis industry. For this reason, we characterized the thermal and cyclic stability of MOF-76 (Y) by thermogravimetric and cycling tests. The results of the thermogravimetric tests are shown in Figure 5a, MOF-76 (Y) remains stable at up to 550 ∼C and undergoes a rapid one-step weight loss from 550-650 ∼C, indicating decomposition of the material.
Question: At how many degrees does the material remain stable?"
