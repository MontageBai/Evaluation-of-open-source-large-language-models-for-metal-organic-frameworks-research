# Evaluation-of-open-source-large-language-models-for-metal-organic-frameworks-research
Large language models evaluation for MOFs is a methodology used to evaluate the performance of large language models in the field of MOFs.


Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are playing an increasingly important role in chemistry and materials research with the development of machine learning, deep learning, and large-scale language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. (GPT: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) development, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are playing an increasingly important role in chemistry and materials research, facilitating materials screening and design. Despite the exciting advances in AI-assisted research based on GPT-4, open-source LLMs have not received much attention from the scientific community. This work focuses on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a subfield of chemistry, and through a comprehensive set of tests covering the basic units of MOFs research.
