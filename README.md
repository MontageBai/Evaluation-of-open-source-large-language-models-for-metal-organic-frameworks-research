Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are playing an increasingly important role in chemistry and materials research with the development of machine learning, deep learning, and large-scale language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. (GPT: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) development, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are playing an increasingly important role in chemistry and materials research, facilitating materials screening and design. Despite the exciting advances in AI-assisted research based on GPT-4, open-source LLMs have not received much attention from the scientific community. This work focuses on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a subfield of chemistry, and through a comprehensive set of tests covering the basic units of MOFs research.
